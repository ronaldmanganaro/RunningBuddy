        <p>
          My blackjack program allows 1 - 3 players to play against a computer controlled dealer. The user is prompted to enter the number of players and then each of the players names.
          The first player to the right of the dealer is allowed to either hit or stay. If the player decides to hit then they will recieve a card and the total next to the corresponding
          players name will change. The player is allowed to hit until their total exceeds 21. If the players hit the stay button it will become the next players turn. After the dealer
          finishes his turn the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. This program can be compiled and run on linux operating systems only.

        <p>
          This blackjack program was written in C++. I used the text editor atom throughout the development cycle. The graphics and audio are being handled by
          <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML: Super Fast Media Library</a>. I created this application for a project in my software development course. The
          purpose of the assignment was to follow the MVC development pattern. MVC stands for model-view-controller. Model, view, and, controller can be seen as
          three interconnected parts that come together to create an application. The model is specifically used to represent the data and nothing else. The view
          is used to diplay data from the model and trigger the controller to handle user interaction. Lastly, the controller provides the data from the model to the view. The
          greatest advantage of using this pattern of software development is that you avoid unnecessary dependencies. In the long run this will help keep the code
          simple to understand and easy to maintain.
